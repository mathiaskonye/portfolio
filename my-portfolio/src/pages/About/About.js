                Hey. Im 23 years young. I grew up in Oslo, Norway and that is
                where I still live today. I started coding and designing
                websites in 2019 and I`ve come a long way since then. I started
                learning HTML/CSS and JavaScript through Noroff School Of
                Technology in Oslo, but I am going to expand my knowledge and
                skills with other programming languages. Infact, I have already
                started.<br></br>
                <br></br>
                Im always eager to learn more because I have a passion for
                developing user-friendly, solid and nice looking websites. These
                are the programming languages I know currently: HTML/CSS, SCSS,
                JavaScript, React.js and Next.js<br></br>
                <br></br> Contact me If you would like to know more!
